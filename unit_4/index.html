<h2>How it all started</h2>

<p>A traditionally run family business that dates back to 1978. The originator of this store was Billy Fok who started this business back in 1978 in Hong Kong and its legacy has since been passed down to his Son Ryan Fok and he has been carrying on his fathers legacy ever since, maintaining the same great flavors from the past. </p>
